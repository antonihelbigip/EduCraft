Hello!

I want to share the latest progress on my project **Minecraft OZE – EcoCraft** (Renewable Energy).

## What I have already done

- I set up two HP EliteDesk servers (Ryzen 5, 32 GB RAM, SSD) running Linux (Xubuntu).
- I launched the main game modes: Proxy, Lobby, PvP, and the EarthMC map (1:1000).
- I installed the essential plugins: EssentialsX, LuckPerms, Citizens, WorldEdit, WorldGuard, TAB, Dynmap.
- I uploaded starter maps for the Lobby and EarthMC.
- I configured a Cloudflare Tunnel — the server is secure and accessible from outside.
- I am monitoring power consumption with a Teccus meter; I plan to integrate this with Home Assistant to display energy usage in real time.

## What I'm working on now

- Integrating the system with LuckPerms so that shops and privileges are tied to ranks.
- Configuring the economy: Vault + Economy + ChestShop (player shops).
- Optimizing RAM and CPU allocation in AMP so each server component runs smoothly.
- Preparing a backup system for maps and configurations — both locally and in the cloud.
- Testing plugins with NPC/AI that will later be used to educate players about renewable energy.

## What's next

- Full launch of the educational version — in-game elements related to renewable energy (PV panels, energy management systems) will be introduced.
- Testing server power supply from solar panels plus batteries (planned this year) — players will be able to see live how much energy comes from renewable sources.
- 3D-printed prototype: server rack — space for PC servers, a network switch, a Raspberry Pi, and an energy bank.

Thank you to everyone who supports this project — your support gives me energy and motivation to keep going.
